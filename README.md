# example-nodejs-web-app
A nodejs web app that uses jsGrid to display, sort, and filter data

To get started
- Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run build` to generate css files
- `npm run start` to run the app

To verify it's working properly, browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Note that this is dependent on the [example-nodejs-backend-svc](https://github.com/kcolso/example-nodejs-backend-svc) which must be running on the same machine

Note that filter currently only works on the `Cryptocurrency Name` column
